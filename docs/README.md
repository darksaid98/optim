Optim is a Fabric modpack that aims to provide maximum performance with some common quality-of-life modifications to the game. It is a highly opinionated selection of mods I intentionally handpicked to share my improved experience with the wider Minecraft community.

## üåü Features

### Main Features

* **Vanilla Parity** - *Doesn't add any new content to the game as it aims to be compatible with all Vanilla servers.*
* **Optifine Parity** - *Replacements for most Optifine features like Shaders, CEM, CIT, Animated & Connected Textures, Capes, Dynamic Lighting and Custom Sky Boxes.*
* **Regularly Updated** - *Actively maintained and updated to newer Minecraft versions.*
* **Optimized** - *Strives to provide the best possible performance while still having all the bells and whistles.*

### Other Features

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Acknowledgments

Optim was created because I grew tired of manually updating my personal selection of mods after every Minecraft update.

The following projects inspired, influenced and or helped me greatly when creating Optim:
- [**mc-modpack-kit**](https://github.com/jh-devv/mc-modpack-kit) - *Used to scaffold this GitHub repository.*
- [**Packwiz**](https://packwiz.infra.link/) - *Exceptional software making modpack maintenance and creation easy.*
- [**Kami Chan Optimized**](https://modrinth.com/modpack/kami-chan-optimized) - *Inspired a few additions like fast-up-ping and Server Pinger Fixer.*
